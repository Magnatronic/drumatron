# Drumatron: Drum Visualization & Audio Detection Web App

Drumatron is a responsive React + Vite + TypeScript web app for music therapy rooms. It visualizes drum hits detected from a microphone, with beautiful, theme-based animations for each drum. Users can tweak detection sensitivity, toggle which drums are active, and select from multiple visual themes (e.g., space, underwater). The app uses Material UI and Material Icons for a modern, accessible interface.
